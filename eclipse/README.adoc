== Eclipse Open Req Client

This is the Eclipse client, which is supposed to show the Results of the Open Req Server in the Eclipse IDE.

== Building the Project

The Project can be built by using following command:

[source, console]
----
$ cd openreq/eclipse/
$ ./mvnw clean verify
----

This will generate a p2 update site in the _openreq/eclipse/com.vogella.prioritizer.updatesite/target/repository_ folder.

This p2 update site can be used to install the openreq client into the Eclipse IDE.
