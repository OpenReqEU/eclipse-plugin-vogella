The following technologies are used:

=== Running the Spring Boot application

In order to run the Spring Boot application the following has to be run on the command line:

[source, console]
----
$ cd openreq/server
$ ./gradlew bRun
----

This can also be run from the IDE by using the Eclipse Buildship 2.x tooling.

=== Installing the Eclipse Plugin

[TIP]
====
Since the Eclipse plug-in is under active development you should consider starting it from the Eclipse IDE.

See <<Eclise-Plugin-Running-From-IDE>>.
====

To install the Eclipse Plugin into the Eclipse IDE the following packages have to be installed:

* All features from the NatTable Update Site - http://download.eclipse.org/nattable/releases/1.5.0/repository/
* All features from the vogella OpenReq 3rd party dependencies - https://dl.bintray.com/vogellacompany/OpenReq-Eclipse/

Since the actual Eclipse plugin has not been released yet the update site has to be generated like this:

[source, console]
----
$ cd openreq/eclipse
$ ./mvnw clean verify
----

This will generate an update site for the Prioritizer Eclipse Plugin in the _openreq/eclipse/com.vogella.prioritizer.updatesite/target/repository_ folder.

Just press on the btn:[Local] and point to the update site folder.

This will list the required features, which have to be installed.

[[Eclise-Plugin-Running-From-IDE]]
=== Running the Eclipse Plugin from the IDE

Import all projects from the openreq git repository into your Eclipse IDE.

Then open the _target-platform.target_ file inside the _target-platform_ project.
This will load all necessary dependencies for the project.

[TIP]
====
In older Eclipse IDE distributions the _Reload Target Platform_ link was called _Set as Active Target Platform_.
====

After the target platform has been set the _Prioritizer-Plugin.launch_ launch configuration can be started by opening the _eclipse_ project and right clicking on the _Prioritizer-Plugin.launch_ file and clicking on the _Run as > Prioritizer-Plugin_ menu entry.

=== What does the application currently do?

In the Eclipse IDE you can install the Prioritzer plug-in and visualize the bugs, which might be interesting for you.

=== What's next?

Further statistics will be provided.

=== Issues

Getting statistics from bugzillas rest api is quite hard and takes some time. Therefore I suggested some enhancements to bugzillas rest api:

=== Metrics with Micrometer IO

The implementation for the Mircrometer IO facade, which will be used is Atlas from Netflix: https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/atlas

Atlas can be run locally. See https://github.com/Netflix/atlas/wiki/Getting-Started#running-demo-with-memory-storage

To query the metrics from Atlas the stack language query has to be used: https://github.com/Netflix/atlas/wiki/Stack-Language#query

For now we intend to run the Atlas server from an Eclipse component and later on we want to omit the server completely and use the Netlix API directly.

==== Download and start an atlas server locally

The following description is based on the link mentioned above: https://github.com/Netflix/atlas/wiki/Getting-Started#running-demo-with-memory-storage

We assume that curl is installed on your system.

[source, console]
----
# create an atlas directory
mkdir atlas

# download the atlas server jar
curl -LO https://github.com/Netflix/atlas/releases/download/v1.5.3/atlas-1.5.3-standalone.jar

# download the memory configuration to persist the data
curl -Lo memory.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Netflix/atlas/v1.5.x/conf/memory.conf

# run the server
java -jar atlas-1.5.3-standalone.jar memory.conf

----


[NOTE]
====
Future versions of this plug-in will start the server automatically for you.
====

Once the server has been started an Eclipse IDE instance can be launched together with the tracing plug-ins in order to visualize user actions. 

To see the different command invocations in a graph just open the _Command Calls Stats_ part.
