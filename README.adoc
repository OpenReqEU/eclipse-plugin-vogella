=== Running the Spring Boot application

In order to run the Spring Boot application the following has to be run on the command line, while being inside the com.vogella.spring.datacrawler directory:

[source, console]
----
./gradlew bRun
----

This can also be run from the IDE by using the Eclipse Buildship 2.x tooling.

=== What does the application currently do?

When starting the application (-> <<running-with-gradle>>) a CommandLineRunner is used to save bugs from Eclipse Bugzilla into a H2 database by using Spring Data.
Saving bugs from Eclipse Bugzilla is also scheduled by using a @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 23 ? * MON-FRI") annotation for the `saveBugs` method of the `BugzillaCommunicationController` class.
